# game-engine-from-scratch
I am writing a game engine from scratch, in C++. 

This is a preliminary repo. As I master C, C++, and concepts of more advanced mathematics, I would like to make a rudimentary 3d game engine that supports collision detection, adjustable environemnt variables, and perhaps multiplayer support.
